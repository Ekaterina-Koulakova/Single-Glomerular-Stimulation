# Experimental Methods

Here you can find an outline of the experimantal approach that we have developed over the past year in pursueing this line of research. Below is the order in which each of the above files should be considered. 

1. [Passive Imaging](https://github.com/ekaterinakoulak/Single-Glomerular-Stimulation/tree/main/Methods/1_Passive_Imaging)

To start this project, we need to identify the principle circuit motif responsible for odor encoding in the olfactory bulb. This circuit motif consists of a glomerulus and its associated projection neurons, known as daughter mitral cells (dMCs).

Once we locate the single glomerulus that we would like to focus our efforts on and identify its dMCs, we will screen a subset of odorants to observe how they influence the selected circuit motif throughout the sniff cycle. After selecting an odorant, we will analyze its effects on dMC activation in response to simultaneous optogenetic stimulation of the associated glomerulus.

2. [Behavioral Training](https://github.com/ekaterinakoulak/Single-Glomerular-Stimulation/tree/main/Methods/2_Behavioral_Training)

Mice don't talk. Yet, we would like to determine whether or not they are able to perceive the optogenetic stimulation of the single glomerulus that we have selected. For this reason, we train them in a Go-NoGo paradigm in which they must lick when they sense a stimulus and withold their lick when they do not perceive the stimulation (insert contentious discussions here). By the end of this step, we train the mice to perform this task as well as identify the minimal possible power with which we can stimulate the single glomerulus to make sure that any interference in the dMCs activation will elicit a change in the behavioral readout acheived. 

3. [Imaging Session with Behavior](https://github.com/ekaterinakoulak/Single-Glomerular-Stimulation/tree/main/Methods/3_Imaging_Session_with_Behavior)

Here, we finally get to the big question: If a background odorant suppressess the activation of a glomerulus' dMCs, is the mouse still able to detect the activation of the parent glomerulus? This is a significant question as the olfactory bulb acts as a mediator between the odorant detected in the nasal epithelium and the rest of the cortex. If the mouse is still able to detect the signal despite its dMCs being suppressed, how is the signal being conveyed to the rest of the cortex to evoke a behavioral response? 

To answer this question, we combine the prior two steps. We stimulate the single glomerulus in the presence of a background odorant while imaging the resultant dMC activation and concurrently acheiving a behavioral readout. In doing so, we will be able to analyse the activation of dMCs in relation to the mouse's detection rate.
