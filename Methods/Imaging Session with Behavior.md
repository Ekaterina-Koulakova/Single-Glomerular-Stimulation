## Imaging Session with Behavior

Here, we attempt to combine all elements of the experiment up until this point. 

INSERT EXPLANATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PLOTS

#### WATER-DEPRIVATION IMPLICATION ON MC IMAGING QUALITY

As you conduct training and take your psychometric curves, it will become evident to you that the quality of your images both at the glomerular and moreso at the MC level become increasingly blurry. Don't panic. This is very likely due to the mouse being in a prolonged state of water deprivation. For this reason, prior to moving onto the next step where we reintroduce imaging, it would be helpful to reintroduce water to the mice. Take some subsequent reference images to verify that water deprivation was in fact the issue with the image quality.

INSERT EXAMPLE WATER DEPRIVATION IMAGES

A few days after reintroducing water, the image quality should significantly improve. Take the water away and shortly after, take a few more days to reinforce the Go-NoGo task with single-pulse stimulation. Once the behavior is back to its original level and the mouse is at 85% of its original body weight, procede to the next imaging step.

### ODOR & STIM Imaging 

We will conduct a Gon-NoGo behavioral session, asking the mouse to lick when it detects a stimulation and to withold its lick when a stimualtion is not present. The trials within the session will be split up between 50% Go trials and 50% NoGo trials. The trial types are as follows:

* stim-only

The first couple (50) of trials in the session will be a stim-only block. This will allow the mouse to not only acclimate to the task at hand, but will also ensure that the stim-only trials are not contaminated by lingering odorants from prior trials.

* empty

Empty trials are those trials for which no stimulation or odorant is issued. These trials will be taken as the NoGo blank trials within the initial stim-only block. This is again to ensure that no lingering odorants contaminate these trials.

* odor-only low concentration

This block will be composed of (20) trials. This will give us 10 trials for which 'odor-only low concentration' images can be taken.

After this block, there will be a block of 20 trials of stim-only which will act as a buffer to reinforce the initial behavioral task.

* odor-only high concentration

This block will be composed of (20) trials. This will give us 10 trials for which 'odor-only low concentration' images can be taken.

After this block, there will be a block of 20 trials of stim-only which will act as a buffer to reinforce the initial behavioral task.

* odor+stim low concentration

This block will be composed of (20) trials. This will give us 10 trials for which 'odor-only low concentration' images can be taken.

After this block, there will be a block of 20 trials of stim-only which will act as a buffer to reinforce the initial behavioral task.
