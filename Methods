## Behavioral Training

### Stim-Detection Training

Train the mice to detect the stimulation of their single glom using a Go-NoGo training paradigm.

#### Stimulation Parameters:

**Stimulation Power**  
Some mice should start with 3.0V training, others with as high as 3.5V applied to the power source. Mice vary in their channelrhodopsin levels in OSNs. If the detection rate reaches a constant 80%, try increasing the power.

| Laser Power Control [V] | Power Density at Window [mW/mm^2] |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1.47                    | 14                                |
| 1.52                    | 22                                |
| 2.01                    | 22                                |
| 2.50                    | 22                                |
| 3.00                    | 35                                |
| 3.50                    | 50                                |
| 4.00                    | 58                                |
| 4.50                    | 61                                |

**Conditions**  
- AOM set to 3.5V
- DMD has 200 x 200 pixels corresponding to 0.25mm²

**Pulse parameters**  
Training is conducted with 10 pulses. Each pulse is \_\_ ms long with a \_\_ ms break in between pulses.

### Lowering Pulse Count

Now, we train the animal to detect shorter pulse sequences until we reach a single pulse.

During a session, it is possible to drop multiple pulse lengths. For example, you can try running behavior for 50 trials with 8 pulses, then 100 at 6, then 150 at 4. Wait until the animal returns to a 90% success rate before decreasing the pulse count.

---

### Psychometric Curve

A psychometric curve will measure the detection rate of the single-pulse stimulation by the power that the stim-laser is set to. The steepest part of this sigmoid curve will be around 75% detection, and we want to understand the power at which this occurs (~80%). 

This helps in two ways:
1. To isolate the principal component of odorant encoding: a single glomerulus and its daughter mitral cells.
2. To measure behavioral output or detection of the stimulation in the presence of a background odorant.

#### Block Trials:

Example power-level lists for some block sessions:

| AOM Power Blocks | Power Levels (%) |
|------------------|------------------|
| Graded (4.0V)    | [100, 75, 65, 55, 35, 0, 100] |
| Graded (4.0V)    | [100, 85, 75, 45, 30, 10, 100] |
| Graded (4.0V)    | [100, 95, 60, 50, 40, 15, 100] |
| Random (4.0V)    | [100, 45, 80, 70, 90, 65, 100] |
| Random (4.0V)    | [100, 30, 85, 50, 90, 55, 100] |

Failed methods like the Probe-Trial Method, while tried, were found inefficient.

## Imaging Session with Behavior

### Single Glomerulus Stimulation at New 80% Detection Power

This session verifies minimal cross-glomerular stimulation when targeting a single glomerulus.

### ODOR & STIM Imaging - Replicating Mursel’s Results with Behavioral Output

Ensure this session follows after the ODOR & STIM session.
