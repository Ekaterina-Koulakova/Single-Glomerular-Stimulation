# Single Glomerular Stimulation Project
A project taken on as a research assistant in Dmitry Rinberg's lab at the NYU Neuroscience Institute where I study the neural encoding of sensory perception in the olfactory bulb. 

As part of my ongoing collaborative research with two postdocs, I am exploring how the signal induced by artificial optogenetic stimuli is transformed from the olfactory bulb to the cortex in a mouse model. To elucidate the neural encoding of this stimuli, we employ optogenetics to target the principle circuit component of the olfactory bulb: the single glomerulus. Specifically, we perform closed-loop optogenetic manipulations at the level of single glomeruli while simultaneously conducting 2P imaging at projection neuron layers, as the the animal concurrently engages in a Go-NoGo behavioral paradigm. In doing so, we aim to not only explore the circuit mechanisms of odor encoding in relation to the relative timing of different glomerular activations, but also acheive a perceptual readout.
