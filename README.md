# Single-Glomerular-Stimulation
A project taken on as a research assistant in Dmitry Rinberg's lab at the NYU Neuroscience Institute, where I study the neural encoding of odors and optogenetic stimuli in the olfactory bulb. 

As part of my ongoing collaborative research with two postdocs, I am exploring how the signal induced by artificial optogenetic stimuli is transformed from the olfactory bulb to the cortex, driving the animal’s behavior. In approaching this investigation, we considered a “cocktail-party problem”, as it has been shown that, if a background odorant activates a glomerulus, the detection of optogenetic stimulation targeted at the same glomerulus is substantially diminished [(Smear, 2013)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3519). To understand at what level of the sensory circuit this inhibition occurs, we propose an experiment where we stimulate a single glomerulus using optogenetics, concurrently imaging the corresponding activation of projection neurons, while the animal is engaged in a Go/No-Go behavioral paradigm.
