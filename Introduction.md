# Introduction

<!--
The Single Glomerular Stimulation project explores how the signal induced by artificial optogenetic stimuli is transformed from the olfactory bulb to the cortex, driving the animal’s behavior. In approaching this investigation, we considered a “cocktail-party problem”, as it has been shown that, if a background odorant activates a glomerulus, the detection of optogenetic stimulation targeted at the same glomerulus is substantially diminished [(Smear, 2013)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3519). To understand at what level of the sensory circuit this inhibition occurs, we propose an experiment where we stimulate a single glomerulus using optogenetics, concurrently imaging the corresponding activation of projection neurons, while the animal is engaged in a Go/No-Go behavioral paradigm.
